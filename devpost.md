## Inspiration
Our application was inspired by two articles published by the Daily Tarheel, which detailed the troubles that those with disabilities can face while traversing campus. Those with limited mobility may find their regular routes to class obstructed by construction, maintenance, or other impedances. We sought to create an application where the community can aid one another in reporting these route outages so that those with conditions impairing their mobility (or any person in general) could be better informed about changes to the campus walkways.

## What it does
Mobility allows users to pinpoint a location on the UNC campus, mark this location as impeding a walkway, and offer users the ability to generate routes that go around such disturbances. 

## How we built it
We built our application using React, HTML, JS, CSS, and Bootstrap on the front end. On the back end, we utilized the Flask Python framework. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges while developing this app. Grabbing the data about the campus' buildings and roads was the first. From there, creating an algorithm that would pair walkways with buildings 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we put together a cohesive product while each of us utilized technologies we had no previous experience with.
